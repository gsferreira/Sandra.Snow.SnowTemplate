This blog post is about one of my other passions, cook! I'm a foodie, not just about the eating part of it, but I also love to cook. So, I want to do some tasty posts and share with you some simple recipes.

Being a programmer is not a healthy profession. We spend long hours sitting in front of a computer and this isn't helping our body. But we can change it by making some sport and putting the fast food aside and start cooking healthy and tasty food!

You can start right now, so I wrote down a recipe that you can make in 15 minutes. I hope you like!
