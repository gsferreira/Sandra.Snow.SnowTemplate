Recently I've brought home a new puppy, named Feijão (the portuguese word for "bean"). Since then I've been reading to learn how to teach him some stuff.

From this experience I've seen that the dog training technique has a kind of flow, like a software routine. So, I have decided to translate some of that tips into code and share with you. I think that this can be a funny way for a developer understand how to teach his dog.

The tips of this series:

 1. Recognize the name
 2. Come when called
 3. Sit
 4. Stay
 5. Lie
