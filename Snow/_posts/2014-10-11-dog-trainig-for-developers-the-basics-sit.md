    public void Sit()
    {

        //Prepare yourself
        _teacher.Sit();

        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
        {
            var snack = _teacher.GrabNewSnack();

            _teacher.LetDogSniff(snack);

            //Dog should follow your hand
            do
            {
                //Dog will try to reach the food
                _teacher.MoveHandUp();

            } while (!_dog.IsSeated);

            _teacher.Say("Sit!");

            _teacher.GiveToDog(snack);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        {
            var snack = _teacher.GrabNewSnack();
            
            _teacher.Say("Sit!");

            do

        }
        
        _teacher.GetUp();
        
        for(int i=0;i<3;i++)

            _teacher.Say("Sit!");

            do

            } while (!_dog.IsSeated);

            _teacher.PlayWithDog(_dog);

        }
